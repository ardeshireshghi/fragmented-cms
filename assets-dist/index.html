It is basically about things in life that I have a flair for, like traveling, food and writing. You may say these topics are already very exposed, and ask why do I feel like there is a need to discuss it even more?</p>
        <p>When I moved to London, years ago, I found it very difficult to adjust to the new culture. After a while, I got sick and my illness was a combination of depression and a severe type of IBS. Treatments wouldn&#x2019;t work for me, so I had to go back to my country to see a specialist on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>During the very first session of therapy I had to answer this question: what do you truly like to do? What things do you have a flair for? And my answer was nothing.</p>
        <p>I could not think of one single activity that made me really excited. At that moment, I started my journey, a journey which led into my recovery and health. I learnt there are lots of small things that can make us happy; things that are not necessarily hard to achieve but simply need our attention.</p>
        <p>I discovered how food makes me cheerful, the joy of combining new and old ingredients, and exploring diverse tastes and colors in restaurants that I haven&#x2019;t been to before. I understood traveling makes me content because it gives me the opportunity to discover more, explore more and learn more.</p>
        <p>So finally, I was happy. I still haven&#x2019;t achieved the goals that I set for myself years ago, but I don&#x2019;t feel like a loser anymore. Although I&#x2019;m still trying to achieve my goals and dreams, I decided to enjoy the ride too. And I wanted you to be a part of this ride with me. For those of you who don&#x2019;t feel hopeful or accomplished or confident, I want you to know that you are not alone. All of us, have the flair and the talent, we just need to give ourselves a chance to discover it. I hope this blog gives you the motivation to find and pursue your very own passion.</p>
